# Not quite chicken and egg

But it's close enough. Every new entrant faces it: to get a dev job, you need dev experience. To gain dev experience you need a dev job.
It may seem like some diabolical conspiracy hatched in the crimson depths of the software development
world's Hades.
And it can be quite frustrating that a number of those who fell in, fell out in no time when faced by this.
Can you blame the companies? Well, they want to be as certain as possible that you can deliver the goods if they hire you -
goods here means "something of value, that can further our cause".
And don't forget that these companies need to survive, and need funds to survive, and get funds when they provide
something of value, and only need you if you're going to add something of value to enable them provide something of value..

You see where all this is going?

# What can one do?

In a word: Open Source (okay, that may be two words).
Open Source may very well be the newbie developer's best bet to not only grow in skill, but also in that vital
experience requirement that is demanded.
Open Source projects are always in need of contributors (competent individuals who can help further their cause(s)..Hey! That looks familiar).

But seriously, it may be the newbie's easiest route to the desired end-result as there's an easier entry path, and
ample opportunities for growth..(you just have to accept the probability that you may not get paid much, or at all, for doing it).

# Important take away

Open Source needs every help it can get. As a newbie, you need every opportunity to gain experience. It could be a win - win.
Take the time to read about [how to start contributing to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/), and take it from there.

Keep an eye out for a follow up article on Open Source projects that may even offer payment for your contribution.
